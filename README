== Gnip Python Client ==

This library provides a Python API for accessing
Gnip (http://gnipcentral.com) web services.  There are two basic
roles for using Gnip: subscribers and publishers.  This library
provides a single interface for both roles.

== Required Libraries ==

These 3rd party libraries are required by the Gnip Client:

- iso8601-0.1.4 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601
- pyjavaproperties-0.3 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyjavaproperties/0.3
- elementtree-1.2.7_20070827_preview - http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm
- davclient-0.2.0 - http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/Davclient

== Install ==

  $> sudo python setup.py install

== Running the Client Library Tests ==

If you have downloaded the complete Gnip Client library source, the unit tests
will be in the test/ directory.  Before running the tests, you will need to 
configure the username, password, and connection information used to connect
to a Gnip server.  To do this, add the ./test/gnip-account.properties file 
that contains the following properties:

gnip.username=your-gnip-username@yourcompany.com
gnip.password=your-gnip-password
gnip.test.publisher=your-test-publisher

Note, for the tests to pass, you must reference a Gnip test publisher that
exists and that you own and thus can be used for publishing activities 
from a unit test. 

For more information about creating a Gnip Publisher, see:

  http://prod.gnipcentral.com

To run the tests, type:

  $> python regression.py

== Consumer ==

=== Example 1: Retrieve all recent activities at a publisher

As a consumer one thing you might be interested in immediately is to
grab recent activity at a particular publisher.  To do this you must
create a connection to Gnip using your user name and password.  Once
that connection is established you can get the publisher and request
its activities stream.  

    gnip = Gnip("me@mydomain.com", "my-password")
    gnip.get_publisher_notifications("digg")

Alternatively, to retrieve the raw XML of the activities, do:

    gnip.get_publisher_notifications_xml("digg")


=== Example 2: Retrieve all activities at a publisher around a specific time

Some times you will want to get activity information from before now.
Doing this look much like getting the recent activity, except that you
past a time when getting the activity stream.  This will return the
activity stream as it existed around that time.  The results will be
include some activities before and after the time you specify.

    gnip = Gnip("me@mydomain.com", "my-password")
    gnip.get_publisher_notifications("digg", datetime.datetime.utcnow() - 
        datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)) # 30 minutes ago


=== Example 3: Create an activity stream that includes only activities
    done by users you care about.

If you would like to filter a set of publishers by the user that
performed the activity you may create a filter to do so.  Once
created a filter's activity stream is retrieved much like a
publishers.  Activity that has already occured will not be included in
a filter.  Therefore any new filter will be empty until some
new matching activity has occured.

Note: Filter names must be unique across the system so you might
want to attach your username to the logical name of any filters
you create.

    gnip = Gnip("me@mydomain.com", "my-password")

    my_filter = Filter(name="test-filter", 
        rules=[["actor", "me"], ["actor", "you"], ["actor", "bob"]])

    gnip.create_filter("digg", my_filter)
    gnip.get_filter_notifications("digg", my_filter)

=== Example 4: Delete a filter

If you decide you no longer need a filter you have created in the
past you can remove it.

    gnip = Gnip("me@mydomain.com", "my-password")

    gnip.delete_filter("digg", "test-filter")

== Publisher

=== Example 1: Create a publisher and publish some activities

If you are interested in publishing activity you will need to create a
publisher.  Once the publisher resource is created, activities can be
published in it's activity stream.

    gnip = Gnip("me@mydomain.com", "my-password")
    gnip.publish("digg")
    
    activity = Activity("joe", datetime.datetime.utcnow(), "post", 
        "http://mydomain.com/joe/my-new-blog-post");
    gnip.publish_activities(my_publisher, [activity])
